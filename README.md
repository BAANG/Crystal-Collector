# Super Duper Mixologist 
Super Duper Mixologist is a game made utilizing primarily Javascript and the jQuery library. 


This is a basic clicker game where the player must match the randomly generated target number to win. If the player's number goes over the target number or "busts", the player loses the round.

This project required the creation and utilization of multiple functions, variables and event listeners within the Javascript in order to track, randomize, and print different values as the game progresses. jQuery was used specifically in order to make the process of coding the Javascript more efficient and ultimately, more organized.
